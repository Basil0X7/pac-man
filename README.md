# The ideas of ​​the game
- eat all pellets that player have to do it 
- let ghost catch pac man before he eats all pellets 
- When Pac-Man eats large pellets, he turns into a monster and can eat ghosts for a period of time

# board 

It is a road or a path through which Pac-Man and the ghosts can walk. \
It is numbers that you,through the pygame library, convert each number to either a line, a quarter circle, or an big and small pellets.

# ghost class

It was the hardest part, as I am still a beginner in pygame and games in general (im a gamer by the way), \
so I had to identify the places where the ghost could walk in and then make him track Pac-Man. \
It is easier said than done, Trust me.

# Current game mode

You can download it and play it continuously. There are only some (this is expected). \
I added some memes,but I want to add sounds, and perhaps I will add levels to increase the difficulty, \
but I want some advice about ghosts.
